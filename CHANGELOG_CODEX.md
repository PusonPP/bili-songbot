## 2026-06-23 11:23:34 UTC — Make overlay notice updates reload from config

Fixed the festival notice not appearing on the current stream.

Root cause:

- The running `bili-songbot.service` process had loaded `config/app.yaml` before the festival notice was added.
- `runtime/ui_overlay.notice.txt` still contained the old notice, and the running process could overwrite manual edits during later UI refreshes.

Changes:

- Refreshed `runtime/ui_overlay.notice.txt` with the festival notice for the currently running FFmpeg overlay.
- Updated `bili_songbot/ui_layer.py` so notice text is read from `config/app.yaml` each time the overlay runtime text files are written.
- Restarted `bili-songbot.service` to load the new overlay notice behavior into the currently running stream.

No secrets were read or changed.

## 2026-06-23 11:00:08 UTC — Add festival notice to live overlay

Added the current event notice to the live overlay right-top announcement:

- `＊当前正在举办 【佐贺偶像是传奇梦幻银河祭】二创庆典`

Also updated the fallback PNG overlay text wrapping helper to respect explicit newline breaks in notices.

No services were restarted or stopped. No secrets were read or changed.

## 2026-06-16 15:10:51 UTC — Initial Git publication preparation

Prepared the project for a first safe Git commit and GitHub push.

Included:

- Expanded `.gitignore` to exclude secrets, runtime state, logs, backups, media files, caches, cookies, and generated artifacts.
- Added a sanitized source snapshot of the paired live-keeper project under `paired/live-keeper/`.
- Updated repository systemd samples to match the current stream-sync topology.
- Added the stream-sync bridge script sample under `scripts/`.

No live services were restarted or stopped. Real `.env`, `stream.env`, cookies, logs, runtime state, media files, and stream keys were not staged.
